# HerSEOn Code Refactoring

## HTML, CSS amd SEO Refactoring

### HTML

The code for HerSEON landing page generated the layout desired, however there were issues with both the HTML and CSS code(s). Refactoring the HTML in this case involved fixing a broken link in the header section, adding a title section, and adding section comments to make the code easier to read. 

### CSS

The CSS stylesheet had selectors that were mixed around and did not follow the flow of the HTML structure. Refactoring involved reorganizing the CSS selectors to follow the same flow as the HTML sections. Section comments were added to further assist in readability. There were also selectors in both the Content and Benefits sections that had redundant rules; these were consolidated for simplicity. Other areas had class selectors that were uneccessarily placed with type selectors in the aforementioned sections; these were removed. 

## SEO

The HTML code lacked helpful SEO tags. A title was added that emphasized the services offered. This title contains keywords that search engines should see to boost positioning in search results. A meta tag was also added with a description and content to further assist in this. Alt tags were added to images with relevant descriptions.
